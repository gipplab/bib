  abstract     = {"Wo Menschen von Lawinen verschuettet werden, zaehlt bei der Rettung und Bergung jede Minute. Was in der Vergangenheit die traditionellen Lawinenhunde geleistet haben, muss in Zeiten des Massen-Tourismus mit technischem Know-how geloest werden. Die Idee von Bela Gipp, Jan-Olaf Stiller und Florian Krueger: Ein System, bei dem eine Infrarotkamera von einem Modellhubschrauber aus Bilder an ein Leitsystem weitergibt, auf dem sich die Temperaturunterschiede zwischen warmen Koerpern und Schnee erkennen lassen. Zur Orientierung des Hubschraubers dient eine zusaetzliche Echtfarbkamera, ein Ultraschallgeraet fuer schlechte Sicht und ein Global Positioning System (GPS). Alles kann mit einem Programm, das die jungen Erfinder geschrieben haben, ueber das Internet gesteuert und ausgewertet werden." 1999, Bundesjury 'Jugend forscht' zu dem Projekt "Der High-tech Bernhardiner"},

  abstract     = {Jedes Jahr sterben auf deutschen Strassen 7.000 Menschen durch Verkehrsunfaelle. Davon koennten ueber 700 vor dem Tod bewahrt werden, wenn die Rettungsdienste unverzueglich nach dem Unfall informiert wuerden. Leider kommt es immer wieder vor, dass Verunfallte erst nach Minuten oder gar Stunden gefunden werden und so wertvolle Zeit bis zur Benachrichtigung der Rettungskraefte verstreicht. Warum nicht das flaechendeckend verfuegbare Mobilfunknetz nutzen, um automatisch Hilfe herbeizuholen? Urspruenglich im Rahmen von Jugend-forscht entwickelten wir in den vergangenen zwei Jahren ein flexibles und kostenguenstiges Notrufsystem - den "GSM Schutzengel". Dieser sieht aus wie ein gewoehnlicher Mobiltelefonakku, enthaelt aber zusaetzlich einen Beschleunigungssensor und einen Mikrokontroller zum Auswerten der Messdaten. Mit dieser Technik ist es moeglich, jedes handelsuebliche Mobiltelefon zu einem mobilen Schutzengel aufzuruesten, der Unfaelle sicher erkennt. Fehlalarme, beispielsweise durch Vollbremsungen waehrend der Autofahrt oder Hinunterfallen des Mobiltelefons, sind dabei ausgeschlossen. Bei einem Unfall ruft der GSM Schutzengel sofort die Rettungskraefte herbei. Dadurch kann selbst bewusstlosen Fahrern schnellstmoeglich geholfen werden. Die Position des Unfalls wird dabei ueber das Mobilfunknetz bestimmt - bis auf 150 m genau. Somit kann zielgenaue Hilfe gewaehrleistet werden, denn wer kann schon direkt nach einem Unfall beschreiben, wo genau er ist?},

  abstract     = {The invention relates to a method and a system for detecting a similarity of documents. The similarity of documents is detected with the help of an analysis of citations in one or more citation document(s), wherein the distance between the individual citations is used as criterion of the analysis. On the basis of the determined distance between two citations, respectively, a similarity value is determined, which is characteristic of the cited documents. A small distance between two citations leads to a high similarity of the cited documents. In case of several citations with regard to documents from several citation documents, the similarity values for the citation pairs from the individual citation documents are used for determining a final similarity value.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present our approach for searching mathematical formulae. We focus on a batch query approach that does not rely on specialized indexes, which are usually domain dependent and restrict the expressiveness of the query language. Instead, we use Stratosphere, a distributed data processing platform for Big Data Analytics that accesses data in a non-indexed format. This system is very effective for answering batches of queries that a researcher may wish to evaluate in bulk on large data sets. We demonstrate our approach using the NTCIR10 Math task, which provides a set of formula patterns and a test data corpus. We showcase a simple data analysis program for answering the given queries. We interpret the patterns as regular expressions and assume that matches to these expressions are also relevant search results to the end-user. Based on the evaluation of our results by mathematicians from Zentralblatt Math and mathematics students from Jacobs University, we conclude that our assumption holds principally with regard to precision and recall. Our work is just a first step towards a well-defined query language and processing system for scientific publications that allows researchers to specify their information need in terms of mathematical formulae and their contexts. We envision that our system can be utilized to realize such a vision.},

@article{JoeranBeelEtAl2016a,
  abstract     = {Numerous recommendation approaches are in use today. However, comparing their effectiveness is a challenging task because evaluation results are rarely reproducible. In this article, we examine the challenge of reproducibility in recommender-system research. We conduct experiments using Plista's news recommender system, and Docear's research-paper recommender system. The experiments show that there are large discrepancies in the effectiveness of identical recommendation approaches in only slightly different scenarios, as well as large discrepancies for slightly different approaches in identical scenarios. For example, in one news-recommendation scenario, the performance of a content-based filtering approach was twice as high as the second-best approach, while in another scenario the same content-based filtering approach was the worst performing approach. We found several determinants that may contribute to the large discrepancies observed in recommendation effectiveness. Determinants we examined include user characteristics (gender and age), datasets, weighting schemes, the time at which recommendations were shown, and user-model size. Some of the determinants have interdependencies. For instance, the optimal size of an algorithms' user model depended on users' age. Since minor variations in approaches and scenarios can lead to significant changes in a recommendation approach's performance, ensuring reproducibility of experimental results is difficult. We discuss these findings and conclude that to ensure reproducibility, the recommender-system community needs to (1) survey other research fields and learn from them, (2) find a common understanding of reproducibility, (3) identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility, (4) conduct more comprehensive experiments, (5) modernize publication practices, (6) foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks, and (7) establish best-practice guidelines for recommender-systems research.},

  abstract  = {In this vision paper, we suggest combining two lines of research to study the collective behavior of Wikipedia contributors. The first line of research analyzes Wikipedia's edit history to quantify the quality of individual contributions and the resulting reputation of the contributor. The second line of research surveys Wikipedia contributors to gain insights, e.g., on their personal and professional background, socioeconomic status, or motives to contribute to Wikipedia. While both lines of research are valuable on their own, we argue that the combination of both approaches could yield insights that exceed the sum of the individual parts. Linking survey data to contributor reputation and content-based quality metrics could provide a large-scale, public domain data set to perform user modeling, i.e. deducing interest profiles of user groups. User profiles can, among other applications, help to improve recommender systems. The resulting dataset can also enable a better understanding and improved prediction of high quality Wikipedia content and successful Wikipedia contributors. Furthermore, the dataset can enable novel research approaches to investigate team composition and collective behavior as well as help to identify domain experts and young talents. We report on the status of implementing our large-scale, content-based analysis of the Wikipedia edit history using the big data processing framework Apache Flink. Additionally, we describe our plans to conduct a survey among Wikipedia contributors to enhance the content-based quality metrics.},
